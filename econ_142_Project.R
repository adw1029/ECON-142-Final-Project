This part is a comment: it won't show in your output. You can use comments to remind you to change the name or the lab number, or a version number. You should use lots of them.  Some excellent economists say that about one quarter of your programs should be comments. Comments are most important in your blocks of code (the grey part of the RMarkdown document)
